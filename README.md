# Ordinary-Least-Squares

The OLS function performs a comprehensive Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression, offering both standard and robust inference metrics. It takes in a dependent variable y and a matrix of independent variables X, with an optional flag to include a constant term. The function estimates the regression coefficients (b) using the normal equations, and calculates residuals (e), standard errors (sterr), and Newey-West adjusted standard errors (NWsterr) to correct for heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation. It also computes the coefficient of determination (Rsquare), its adjusted version (adjRsquare), and optionally, an F-statistic (Fstat) to test linear restrictions on the coefficients under a null hypothesis H0: Rb = r. Internally, it dynamically chooses the Newey-West lag length using a plug-in rule. The function provides a robust and flexible toolkit for linear regression analysis, with support for both classical and heteroskedasticity-consistent inference.
